<h1>The Best Kdramas According to Justine</h1>
<h2> My top 3 kdramas of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>3. Missing You</h3>
<p> This drama is one of the very first melodrama- genre series that I watched. 
    It was starring by Yoo-chun parK, Yu-Sung ho, Kim-so hyun, 
    Yoo-Eun hye. The drama is very sad. It is about the that has been replaced 
    by revenge because of the incident happened when they were young. I actually 
    watched the first four episodes for so many times. This drama is perfect 
    to watch during rainy season.</p>
<h3>2. Cheese in the trap</h3>
<p> I watched a lot of kdramas that I forget most of them but this one is one 
    of the kdramas I watched when I was a teenager. I seldom go outside to 
    play with my friends because I rather choose to stay at home and 
    binged-watch my favorite series. It is about a college student who has to 
    juggle between earning a living and pursuing studies.</p>
<h3>1. I hear your voice</h3>
<p> This is the first Kdrama that I watched. It is starring by lee jong suk, 
    lee bo young and lee da hee. Kim so hyun is also a cast of this show 
    and played the young lee bo young. It is a drama about justice and love.</p>
